# WebXR-HTTPS
https webxr templates for local XR development

@grrrwaaa amd @rglenn -- don't bother with using the template feature just yet can you clone or dl?

clone repo .. init npm/node as usual .. run node ./server.js .. firefox and/or chrome should ask for cert permissions already setup ... have tried on multiple computures so far so good as an insta port for Alice Lab
